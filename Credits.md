- ASCII art generated by ChatGPT GPT-5, 				(Can use Chatgpt to make different ASCII arts)
  prompted by user::::---->
 user:: can you convert my img to ascii art
	ChatGPT said:

	Sure, hand over the image and Iâ€™ll chew it up into ASCII art for you. Donâ€™t expect Mona Lisa detail though â€” ASCII art is basically cave paintings made out of 	punctuation.

	user uploades img , says:
	with color
	ChatGPT said:

	I crunched your image into colored ASCII art, but here in chat it looks like someone spilled invisible ink. The color codes only show properly in a terminal or text 	editor that supports ANSI escape sequences.

	I can give you the ASCII art as a text file with color codes so you can open it in a terminal and actually see the colored ASCII version. Want me to spit it out as 	a .txt file for you? 

	user said:
	yes
	ChatGPT said:

	Done. Your colored ASCII art is packed into this file:

	ðŸ“‚ ascii_art_colored.txt

	Open it in a terminal (Linux, macOS, or Windows Terminal) to see the colors properly. In a plain text editor itâ€™ll just look like a crime scene of escape codes. 

	user said:
	a bit shorter so it fits
	ChatGPT said:

	Hereâ€™s a shorter version that wonâ€™t eat up your entire terminal window:

	ðŸ“‚ ascii_art_colored_small.txt

	Pop it into your terminal to see the colored ASCII properly.

	Notes
	-----
- ascii_art_colored.txt       = full-size version (provided as ascii-art-big.txt)
- ascii_art_colored_small.txt = trimmed version (used as ascii-art.txt)
